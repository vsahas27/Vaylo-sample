# Steering Clear of Common AI Writing Pitfalls

While AI is a powerful tool, it’s not without limitations. Avoid these pitfalls to make the most of AI-generated content:

1. **Over-reliance on AI:**  
   AI isn't a substitute for human creativity or critical thinking. Always review and refine outputs.

2. **Generic Content:**  
   Poorly fine-tuned prompts lead to bland results. Ensure your instructions are clear and detailed.

3. **Lack of Originality:**  
   Without unique insights or perspectives, your content might lack personality.
